1. Kubernetes Basics - What is the difference between a Deployment and a StatefulSet? When would you use each?
>>>
Difference between Deployment and StatefulSet

Deployment:
Used for stateless applications. It manages pods by ensuring the desired number are running

StatefulSet:
Used for stateful applications that need stable, persistent storage, like databases. Pods get persistent storage and stable hostnames, so they maintain identity across restarts.

When to use:

Use Deployment for web servers, APIs, or any stateless app where pods can be replaced freely.

Use StatefulSet for apps like databases, message queues, or any app that needs to keep data or identity across restarts.


2. Helm - How do you override values in a Helm chart during installation or upgrade?
>>>
helm install my-release my-chart --set replicaCount=3
or
helm upgrade my-release my-chart --set replicaCount=3


3. Terraform - What is the purpose of a remote backend (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB) and why is it important?
Remote backend stores your Terraform state file outside your local machine, like in AWS S3.

DynamoDB is often used for state locking to prevent multiple people running Terraform simultaneously and causing conflicts.

It’s important because it enables team collaboration, state consistency, and prevents state corruption in shared environments.


4. Troubleshooting - A pod is stuck in CrashLoopBackOff. What two commands would you run first to find the cause?
>>>
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> — to get event logs and understand recent pod lifecycle info and errors.
kubectl logs <pod-name> [-c <container-name>] — to view the container logs and see what caused the crash.

5. Docker - Name two ways to reduce the size of a Docker image.
>>
Use smaller base images like alpine instead of full OS images.

Minimize layers by combining commands and cleaning up temporary files after package installs in the same RUN statement.
